LESSON 2: Cell Formatting

2
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,750
Welcome to Lesson 2!

3
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:12,916
In this video, you will learn how
to format a cell in Microsoft Excel.

4
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:17,431
This is a cell, all these rectangles are cells!

5
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:21,129
You can manually fill a cell by typing inside it.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,377
You can also click a cell and type in its formula box.

7
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:31,397
But sometimes, you need to fill in lots of cells and that can take a long time.

8
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,397
That's where the Fill Handle comes in!

9
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:39,414
The Fill Handle can help you fill in lots of cells at once.

10
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:44,985
You can either copy a cell to other
cells or copy a pattern to other cells.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,947
Let’s try copying “Hello” to the other cells below it.

12
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:52,525
To do so, drag this little cross down.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,872
There you go!

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,802
Now, let’s try filling 10 cells in
Column A with numbers 1 to 10.

15
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:04,775
To do so, we must manually fill in the numbers 1 and 2.

16
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:12,318
Then, we can highlight both cells, drag the
little cross down until we reach cell A10.

17
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:17,658
Excel will automatically fill in the cells
with the same pattern as the original cell.

18
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:21,557
But remember that you
must manually fill in the first

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,047
two cells so that Excel
will understand the pattern.

20
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,397
Now, let’s talk about Split.

21
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:32,381
You can use Split to separate words
or numbers that are together in one cell.

22
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,260
Here's how you do it.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,939
We have Jane Doe in cell A1

24
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,239
to separate Jane and Doe into two other cells

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,402
let's select this cell and go to the
Data Tab and click on Text to Columns.

26
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:48,195
A little box will pop up

27
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:51,429
choose Delimited and then click Next

28
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:54,900
After that, you will be asked to choose a delimiter.

29
00:01:55,575 --> 00:02:01,341
The data inside a cell can be separated
with tab, semicolon, comma or space.

30
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:04,345
Since our data in
A1 is separated with a

31
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,679
comma, let’s choose
comma and then click next.

32
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,158
Now, let’s click on Finish.

33
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:11,562
There you have it!

34
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:15,112
Jane and Doe are now split into different cells.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,752
Now, let’s proceed to Transpose.

36
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:22,021
Transpose in Excel is a
function that lets you flip or rotate

37
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:25,883
the range of cells from rows
to columns, or columns to rows.

38
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:31,416
We are gonna teach you the fastest
and easiest way to transpose data in Excel.

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,662
Let’s look at this schedule.

40
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:36,062
It has 4 columns and 2 rows.

41
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:40,106
Highlight all of it and clicking
copy from the clipboard.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,989
Let’s now select 2 columns and 4 rows over here.

43
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:50,043
Then we click the right button of our mouse
and you can see the paste options here.

44
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,033
Let’s click this Transpose paste button.

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,550
Very good!

46
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:58,083
You have successfully transposed data in Excel.

47
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,533
Excellent work!

48
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:05,450
Now you know how to fill, split and
transpose cells in Microsoft Excel!
