Lesson 3: Sort and Filter

2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:10,360
Hey there, today we are going to
learn about Sorting and Filtering!

3
00:00:11,154 --> 00:00:15,114
You can find the Sort and Filter
under the Home Tab, right here.

4
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:20,951
Sorting is like when you put all of your
toys in order from biggest to smallest.

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,688
In Excel, you can sort your data the same way!

6
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:31,289
You can choose to sort by numbers, letters, colors, dates or anything else you want.

7
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:35,185
In this column we have 5 different toys.

8
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:42,143
We have a dollhouse, a ball, an airplane toy, an elephant and a car toy.

9
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:47,117
Let’s sort these toys from A
to E based on the first letter.

10
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:51,969
Highlight all these cells, then let’s go ahead and click Sort and Filter.

11
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:54,755
Click Sort A to Z.

12
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:56,467
Perfect!

13
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:59,214
Now our toys are sorted from A to E.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,100
Now, let’s talk about Filter.

15
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:07,075
In Excel, a filter is like a
magic tool that helps you find

16
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:12,033
and see only the information
you want from a big list or table.

17
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:16,146
Let’s go ahead and look at our sorted list of toys again.

18
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:22,383
Let’s highlight all of it and click
on Sort and Filter then click Filter.

19
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:26,512
Now, you will see a little arrow down button here.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,872
Let’s click it and find out how to filter.

21
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:33,233
Let’s click Text Filter and choose Begins with.

22
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:38,536
This filter will only show text that begins with a certain letter.

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,002
Let’s type A here and click OK.

24
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:43,482
There you go!

25
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,699
Only the Airplane toy can be seen because
its the only toy that begins with letter A!

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,220
Excellent Work! Now you know how to sort and filter data in Microsoft Excel. In the next video, you will learn about basic arithmetic operations in Excel.

27
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:56,433
Now you know how to sort
and filter data in Microsoft Excel.
