Lesson 6: References

2
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:08,318
Welcome to Lesson 6!

3
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:12,824
In this video, we will be
learning about the References tab.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,589
This is the references tab

5
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:17,869
It has many tools that can help you.

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:22,956
First, let’s talk about how to insert a Table of Contents.

7
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:28,878
A table of contents is like a map for
all the content that is in our document.

8
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:33,533
It makes it easier for us to find what we are looking for.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,346
To add a table of contents, let’s
click this button and choose a template.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,053
Now you have an empty table of contents.

11
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:53,210
To update this, make sure that all the titles that you want to be
in this table of contents must be using the Headings 1 text style.

12
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,423
What do I mean by that?

13
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:58,183
Let’s go ahead and look at this book.

14
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:00,862
This book has 3 chapters.

15
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:05,382
It has chapters 1, 2, 3.

16
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,160
To include chapter 1 in the table of contents

17
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:13,257
Let’s highlight “Chapter 1” and click Headings 1.

18
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:19,210
Now, let’s go back to the table of
contents and click the update table.

19
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,760
There you go

20
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:25,737
Chapter 1 and its page number can
now be seen in the table of contents.

21
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:30,862
Repeat the process until all
chapters are in the table of contents.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,640
Next, we are going to talk
about the Footnote and Endnote.

23
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:40,484
Footnotes are like secret messages at the bottom of the page

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,679
They help explain things and make your writing even better.

25
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:49,791
Endnotes are like secret messages at the end of the whole writing.

26
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:54,333
They're just like hidden treasures waiting for you to discover!

27
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,314
To add a footnote or endnote,
just click where you want to add it.

28
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,296
Choose either "Insert Footnote" or "Insert Endnote".

29
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,119
Then write your secret message!

30
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:10,542
Let’s click Insert Footnote and type “Hello world”.

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,789
It's super easy, right?

32
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,652
Let’s move on to the Citations and Bibliography

33
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:22,937
A citation is giving credit to the authors
that wrote the book you based your ideas from.

34
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:30,649
It usually follows an APA format and displays the author’s name and the year the book was published.

35
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:37,337
To add a citation, click the Insert Citation button and click Add New Source

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,219
You can choose the type of source, it can
be a book, journal, article and many more.

37
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:52,140
Now, let’s type in the Author’s name, the Title
of the book, the Year, City and Publisher.

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,396
As you can see the proper
citation is now in your document.

39
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:00,801
Now, let’s talk about the Bibliography.

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,855
A Bibliography also gives credit to the authors.

41
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:11,458
But it displays the author’s name, the year,
title, and place where the book was published.

42
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:16,183
Since we already have put the book information earlier

43
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:23,149
All we have to do now is click on the Bibliography button and then choose from any of these templates.

44
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:25,624
Excellent work!

45
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,891
Now you know all about the References Tab.
