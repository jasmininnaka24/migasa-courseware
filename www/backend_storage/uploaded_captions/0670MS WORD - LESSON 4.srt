Lesson 4: Header, Footer, and Symbols

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:07,949
Hello there!

3
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:12,706
In this video, we will be learning
about Header, Footer and Symbols.

4
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:16,262
This is where you will
find the Header and the Footer.

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,793
A header is placed on top of the page.

6
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,662
A footer is placed on the bottom of the page.

7
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:28,995
To add a header, click on this button
and you will see header templates.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,516
Templates are ready-to-use
and will make things easier for you.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,750
To add a footer, click on this button and you will see footer templates.

10
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:43,866
You can also double click on the
top part of the page

11
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:47,350
To insert a header and start typing just like this.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,793
You can do the same to insert a
footer and start typing just like this.

13
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:55,583
You may also add a page number.

14
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:59,872
A page number can be placed in the header or footer.

15
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:06,206
To add a page number, click on this button and you will see Page number templates.

16
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,285
Let’s choose this.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,839
Can you see the page numbers on the pages?

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:20,435
Microsoft Word automatically counts the pages and places
a page number in each page with just a few clicks.

19
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:25,052
From here, you can also insert a textbox and word art.

20
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:30,881
Since we already talked about how
to add a textbox in the previous lesson

21
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,940
We will only try word art this time.

22
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:36,972
To add a word art, click this button.

23
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:39,710
Can you see the beautiful word art?

24
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:45,018
There are many and you can choose
anything to make your text look nice.

25
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,922
Let’s try by clicking on this word art.

26
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:52,597
Once this box appears, we can start typing inside it.

27
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,002
Perfect!

28
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,368
We now have beautiful word art.

29
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:59,333
Let’s move on to Symbols.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,170
A symbol is a representation of anything.

31
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,775
These are examples of symbols.

32
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:13,243
To insert a symbol, simply click on this button
and choose from the different kinds of symbols.

33
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:16,543
A symbol can also be used in equations.

34
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:26,064
An equation is like a mathematical sentence, it
uses symbols like plus, minus, times and many more.

35
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:30,322
To insert an equation, click this button.

36
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,295
Once you click it, all these symbols and equations will
appear together with a small box that looks like this.

37
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:44,064
This is the equation box, this is where you will put your equation

38
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,833
Let’s try creating an equation of 2 times ½.

39
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:53,516
To do so, click on the equation box and type 2.

40
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:57,591
Then, click on the multiplication symbol.

41
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:03,058
After that, click on the fraction
equation and choose this fraction.

42
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:08,306
The top part is for the numerator and
the bottom part is for the denominator.

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,864
Our numerator is 1 and our denominator is 2.

44
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,580
Very good! We now have an equation.

45
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,646
Congratulations!

46
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:22,863
Now you know how to insert a header, footer and symbol.
