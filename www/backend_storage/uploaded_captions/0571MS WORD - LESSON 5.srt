00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:08,343
Are you ready to learn?

3
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:13,302
In this video, we are going to talk about Microsoft Word Layout.

4
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:17,085
A layout is how a certain thing is arranged.

5
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:21,631
In Microsoft Word, you can adjust the page layout.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,417
Here are the tools that will help you change the page layout.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,259
First, let’s talk about Margins.

8
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:37,183
A margin is made up of horizontal and vertical
lines that serve as an invisible guide

9
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:41,712
A margin may look like this, but you can’t really see it.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,880
Microsoft Word has different kinds
of margins. Let’s click here to find out.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,470
Changing the margin will change the
way your text looks like in the document.

12
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:56,572
Let’s try choosing this margin.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,825
Do you see the difference?

14
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:03,995
You can also click on Custom
Margins to customize your own margin

15
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:08,482
You can adjust the
numbers to go higher or lower.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,396
Next, we have the Orientation.

17
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:16,020
A page orientation is how the page is laid out.

18
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:22,056
There are two types, landscape orientation and portrait orientation.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,762
Let’s try changing the orientation to landscape.

20
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:27,642
There you go!

21
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,269
The page has become wider.

22
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,546
Let’s bring it back to portrait.

23
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,532
Can you see the difference?

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,339
Let’s move on to the size.

25
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:41,830
A document can be in many sizes.

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,653
Let’s click here to find out the sizes.

27
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:48,576
The most common sizes are A4 and Letter.

28
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:52,130
Let’s try clicking on this page size.

29
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:54,889
Can you see the difference?

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,886
The page has become longer.

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,739
Now, let’s talk about columns.

32
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,385
A column is a vertical division of text.

33
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:06,181
This is a column.

34
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,578
This is also a column.

35
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:10,752
There are two columns.

36
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,864
Let’s click here and change it to three columns.

37
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:18,167
Great! We now have three columns.

38
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,541
Congratulations!

39
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:24,373
Now you know how to use Page Layout in Microsoft Word.
