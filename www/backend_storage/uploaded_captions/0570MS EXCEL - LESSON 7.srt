LESSON 7: Excel Functions

2
00:00:06,184 --> 00:00:09,796
Hi there! Are you ready to
learn about the Excel Functions?

3
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:16,540
So, in this video, we will be learning
how to do the different functions of Excel.

4
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:19,760
Excel Function is a
mathematical calculation

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:22,971
that is used to calculate
values in a spreadsheet

6
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:25,511
Let’s start with AVERAGE.

7
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:30,247
The Average function is used to
generate a number that represents

8
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:34,706
a typical value from a range,
distribution, or list of numbers.

9
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:39,997
For example, let's say you want to find the average of the following numbers

10
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:44,019
10, 15, 20, 25, and 30.

11
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:48,328
Now, click on the cell where
you want the average to appear.

12
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:51,555
And then after that type the formula

13
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:58,998
=AVERAGE (A1:A5) in the cell

14
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:03,303
“AVERAGE” is the function,
inside the parentheses are

15
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:07,463
the cell names A1 and A5
which are separated by a colon.

16
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:14,525
This formula tells Excel to find the
average of the values in cells A1 to A5.

17
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:18,428
Then press Enter to calculate the average.

18
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:22,221
Now, the result will appear in the cell you selected.

19
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:26,120
If you don’t want to type
the formula, you can also

20
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:29,985
highlight cells A1 to A5
and this little box will appear.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,217
Click this and go to Totals, then click Average.

22
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:40,010
This will automatically show you the
average without typing in the formula.

23
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,633
MIN and MAX

24
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:47,352
Now, let’s move on to the MIN and MAX functions in Excel

25
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:53,065
The MIN function returns the smallest value in a range of cells.

26
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:56,742
While the MAX function returns the largest value.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,437
Let's find out the smallest value among these numbers.

28
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:04,026
Let’s select this cell and type the formula

29
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:10,626
=MIN(A1:A5)

30
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:17,183
Again, we started with the equal sign,
the function, and then the cell names.

31
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:20,392
Now, let’s press Enter on the keyboard.

32
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:21,801
Excellent!

33
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:24,265
You can now see the smallest value.

34
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:27,511
Now let’s find out the largest value.

35
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:31,344
To do so, click on this cell and type the formula

36
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:38,068
=MAX(A1:A5)

37
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:39,473
 then press Enter

38
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,091
Good job!

39
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:46,624
Next, let’s work on how to add the
Date & Time in Excel automatically.

40
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,589
To do so, just click on any cell and type the formula

41
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:54,695
=NOW()

42
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,095
then press Enter

43
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:57,858
There you go!

44
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:01,502
The time and date is now
displayed and this will update

45
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:04,651
automatically every time
you open the Excel file.

46
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:08,380
Next, we will talk about the COUNT function.

47
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:13,047
This function will count the
number of cells that have numbers.

48
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,414
This will not work on cells with text.

49
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,071
Let’s look at this table.

50
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:22,870
Many of these cells have
numbers but some have text, instead

51
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:26,793
of counting them one by one,
let’s use the COUNT function.

52
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:29,755
Let’s select this cell and type in the formula

53
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:36,433
=COUNT(A1:A20)

54
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,433
then click enter

55
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:39,492
There you have it

56
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:43,147
we can now see the number
of cells with numerical values

57
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:46,436
Now, let’s move on to the “IF” Function

58
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,460
The IF function is one of the most commonly used functions in Excel.

59
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,581
It allows you to test a condition
and return one value if the

60
00:03:56,605 --> 00:04:00,954
condition is true, and other
value if the condition is false.

61
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,102
Does it sound complicated?

62
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,580
Well, just imagine this scenario.

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,456
A raincoat is only used when it is raining outside right?

64
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,590
IF it is raining

65
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:14,135
then you will wear a raincoat

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,568
IF it is not raining

67
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,734
then you will not wear a raincoat

68
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,711
Now are you ready to use the IF function?

69
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,088
Great! Let’s try the rain scenario first.

70
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:32,524
You can see that in A1, the data is “Raining”.
While in A2, the data is “Not Raining”.

71
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:37,905
In column B, let’s try to find out if
we should wear a raincoat or not.

72
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:41,377
In cell B1, type the formula

73
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:58,376
=IF(A1=”Raining”, “Yes”, “No”)

74
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:03,119
If A1 is equal to Raining then the word Yes will be displayed

75
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:05,619
 if not then No will be displayed.

76
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,537
Now, let's press Enter.

77
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,267
There you go! Yes is displayed
because A1 is equal to raining.

78
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,503
Now, let’s talk about CONDITIONAL FUNCTIONS.

79
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:22,779
Let’s talk about the conditional function, SUMIF.

80
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:27,978
Let’s look at this table and find
out the total sum of all the Carrots.

81
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:32,124
To do so, select this cell and type in this formula

82
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:46,730
=SUMIF(A1:A10, “Carrot”, B1:B10)

83
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:52,463
This is the function, this is the range of
cells where you want to find carrots, this is

84
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:58,056
the criteria which is the word “Carrot” and
this is the range of cells that you will sum up.

85
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,140
Now, let’s click enter and see the total sum of all the Carrots.

86
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,251
Very good!

87
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:09,940
Now, let's talk about the
conditional function,  COUNTIF.

88
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:13,374
Let’s try to find out the count of Broccolis.

89
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:16,040
To do so, type this formula

90
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:26,728


91
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:30,259
This formula will find
all the broccolis and

92
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:33,277
count how many there
are in cells A1 to A10.

93
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:38,069
Finally, we have the conditional function, AVERAGEIF.

94
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:41,960
Let’s try to find out the average price of Eggplant.

95
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,494
To do so, type this formula

96
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:58,376
 =AVERAGEIF(A1:A10, "Eggplant",   B1:B10)

97
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:06,374
This formula will add all the prices of the Eggplants
you can find in B1 to B10 and then divide it by

98
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:14,151
the number of Eggplants you can find in A1 to A10 and
then finally reveal the average price of Eggplant.

99
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,336
Excellent work!

100
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,935
Now you know the different functions in Microsoft Excel.

101
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:25,624
In the next video, you will be making a
simple budget system for a Lemonade Stand.
