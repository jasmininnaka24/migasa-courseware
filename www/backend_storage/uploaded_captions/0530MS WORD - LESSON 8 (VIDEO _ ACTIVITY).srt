The Design Tab has many tools that will

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,210
Let’s talk about Themes.

6
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:30,271
A theme in MS Word is a set of colors, fonts, and styles that
all work together to make your document look really nice.

7
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:33,860
Let’s click here to see the different Themes.

00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,577
This is Document Formatting

9
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:42,155
 It is also like a theme but it changes the way your document is formatted.

10
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:49,023
This is Colors, it has many color palettes
that can be used for Document Formatting.

11
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:53,343
A color palette is a set of different colors

12
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:56,743

In the Design Tab, you can also add a watermark.

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,435
A watermark can be a text or
picture that is placed behind the text.

16
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:14,592
It is usually used to claim ownership.

17
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:19,069
Let’s click this to see the
different kinds of watermarks.

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,067
A watermark has a low opacity,
you can see it but not so much.

19
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:30,705
You can customize or change the text watermark
by clicking this and when the little box appears

20
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,660

27
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:59,159
A page border is made up of lines all around the page.

28
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:02,034
It may look like a picture frame.
