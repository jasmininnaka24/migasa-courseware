00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:04,266
Hey there! It’s activity time!

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:08,021
You are almost done with the Microsoft Excel Course

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,921
you just have one more thing to do.

4
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:16,733
In this activity we will be making a Simple
Budget System for Rosa’s Lemonade Stand.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,200
First, let’s open Microsoft Excel
and create a new workbook.

6
00:00:22,103 --> 00:00:26,340
Let’s make a table for Expenses
first. Add In the headers;

7
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:30,602
“Item”, “Quantity”, “Unit Cost”
and “Total Cost” in Row 1.

8
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:36,691
Then under Item, let’s list Lemons, Sugar, Cups and Ice.

9
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:42,860
Under Quantity, let’s list 100, 200, 150, 60.

10
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:48,535
And under Unit Cost, let’s list; 2,3,1,5.

11
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,642
Let’s highlight these cells, go to the Insert tab and click table.

12
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:56,353
Check this little box then click OK.

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,566
Now we have a table. But
we need to find out the total

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,146
cost! Let’s click on this
cell and type in the formula

15
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:08,479
=B2*C2

16
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:13,336
Drag the cross down to copy the formula to the other cells and there you go!

17
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:15,195
Very good!

18
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:19,644
To calculate the total expenses,
let’s type “Total Expenses”

19
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:23,464
in this cell and click on this
cell then type this formula

20
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:29,966
 =SUM(D2:D5)

21
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:31,311


22
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,393
The Total Expenses can now be seen in the worksheet.

23
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:38,405
Next, we have to make another table.

24
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,983
This is what we call the Sales table.

25
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:44,695
Hop on to the 8th row and add in the headers

26
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:48,620
“Item”, “Quantity”, “Unit Cost” and “Total Cost”

27
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:55,043
Then under Item, we will list the different
kinds of Lemonades Rosa is selling.

28
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,913
Let’s add in, “Regular” “Pink” and “Blue”.

29
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:00,414
Very good!

30
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,905
Let’s take this chance to turn this into a table.

31
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:08,786
Simply highlight these cells, go to Insert and then click the table.

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,331
Now, let’s continue adding the Quantities of each item.

33
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:19,407
Rosa sold 50 regular lemonades, 40
pink lemonades, and 53 blue lemonades.

34
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:24,184
Under Unit Cost let’s type in the price of each lemonade.

35
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:28,463
Regular costs 35, pink and blue costs 40.

36
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:29,928
Very good!

37
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,205
Now, let’s calculate the total cost.

38
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:37,375
To do so, click on cell D9 and type this formula

39
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,910
=B9*C9

40
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:45,078
Drag the little cross down to copy the formula to other cells.

41
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,467
Excellent!

42
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:51,175
To calculate the total sales,
let’s type “Total Sales” in

43
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,728
this cell and click on this
cell then type this formula

44
00:02:55,072 --> 00:03:01,471
=SUM(D9:D11)

45
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:06,680
Wow! Rosa earned a lot from her lemonade stand!

46
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:10,474
Now, let’s see how much her profit is.

47
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:16,349
To do so, let’s type “Profit” in this cell then type this formula in this cell

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,975
=D12-D6

49
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:27,641
We subtracted the total expenses from the
total sales to see Rosa’s overall profit.

50
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,979
Did Rosa profit from her business or lost?

51
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,823
To find out, let’s click on this cell and type this formula

52
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:49,204
=IF (D13>D6, "PROFIT", "LOSS")

53
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:55,297
This means that if her total sales
is greater than her total expenses,

54
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:58,487
then Rosa earned PROFIT. But
if not, then Rosa earned a LOSS.

55
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:00,539
Now, let’s click enter.

56
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,165
Hooray! Rosa earned PROFIT.

57
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:05,196
Excellent work!

58
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:07,741
You helped Rosa manage
her small business and

59
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,287
you also learned how
to use Microsoft Excel.

60
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:13,650
Congratulations on making it this far!
