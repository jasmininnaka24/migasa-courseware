 Lesson 6: Charts

2
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:06,955
Welcome to Lesson 6!

3
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:09,977
In this lesson, we will be learning about charts!

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,477
What is a chart?

5
00:00:11,823 --> 00:00:15,683
A chart is a visual representation
of data from a spreadsheet

6
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:19,567
that can help us to understand
the information more easily.

7
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:24,359
To make our chart, let’s go back
to the table we made from Lesson 5.

8
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:28,951
In this table we have
the Item, Group and Price.

9
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:33,836
Now let’s do a little magic
and add the total sales of each

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,169
product from the months of
January, February and March.

11
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,974
Wow! We sold a lot of items!

12
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:48,316
Let’s try to find out which group sold
the most during the month of March.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:55,649
To do so, let’s click on this cell here and press the control button and the letter Q on the keyboard.

14
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:58,378
Now this little box will pop up.

15
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:01,187
This is called quick analysis.

16
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,542
Now, let’s click on charts.

17
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:06,533
You will see more than one Clustered chart

18
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,017
click the first one.

19
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:09,139
Great!

20
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:12,002
Now we have a clustered
chart where we can see

21
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:15,139
what group sold the most
during the month of March.

22
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,952
Creating a chart will also add a
new worksheet to your workbook.

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,048
You can also make other
kinds of charts by going to

24
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:26,708
the Insert tab and choosing
from these kinds of charts.

25
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:28,485
We have

26
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:32,526
column charts

27
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:34,845
line charts

28
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:37,190
pie charts

29
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,446
hierarchy charts

30
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,850
statistical charts

31
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:43,853
scatter charts

32
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:45,786
stock charts

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,242
and even combo charts

34
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:49,931
Good job!

35
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:52,386
Now, you know how to create charts.
