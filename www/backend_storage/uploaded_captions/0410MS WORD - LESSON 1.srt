00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,289
Hi there!

3
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,035
Welcome to Lesson 1

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:14,562
In this video, we will be learning
the basics of Microsoft Word.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,926
First, let’s define Microsoft Word

6
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:26,197
Microsoft Word is a computer program that
lets you create documents such as letters.

7
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:33,339
Let’s start by opening Microsoft
Word and clicking on “Blank document"

8
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,860
This is what you should see.

9
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:40,310
Let’s look at the left
top-most part of your screen.

10
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:45,795
This is the save button, it will keep
your document in your computer.

11
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:50,829
This is the undo button, it will
take away the last thing you did.

12
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,762
This is the redo button, it
will reverse an undo action.

13
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:00,108
Now, let’s move to the right
top-most part of your screen.

14
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,518
These are the main control buttons.

15
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,339
This button will minimize your Microsoft Word.

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,131
This button will make your
Microsoft Word smaller or bigger.

17
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,866
And this button will take you out of Microsoft Word.

18
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:33,697
So, don't click it yet, unless you are done!

19
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:36,616
This is the horizontal ruler.

20
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:39,285
And this is the vertical ruler.

21
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:41,427
Great!

22
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,956
Let’s try typing “Hello world” in
our document by using our keyboard.

23
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,939
This is what a keyboard looks like.

24
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:54,433
A keyboard has many letters, numbers, and symbols.

25
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:58,229
To type, simply press the buttons you need.

26
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:11,654
For this, we will need H-E-L-L-O W-O-R-L-D.

27
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:13,188
Great!

28
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:16,183
We just typed Hello World.

29
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,578
Let’s change the font style and font size.

30
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:25,643
A font is a set of letters, number and symbols.

31
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,784
To change the style, click here.

32
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,931

Now let’s type “Hello World” again.

36
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,947
Excellent! Do you see the difference?

37
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:47,547

00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,888
To change the font color, click this.

52
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:33,933
