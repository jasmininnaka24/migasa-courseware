Lesson 7: Mail Merge

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,623
Welcome to Lesson 7!

3
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:12,700
In this video, we will be learning about Mail Merge.

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:20,116
Mail Merge will help you create a lot of
letters, invitations, certificates and many more.

5
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:23,739
Have you ever tried writing a letter?

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,058
A letter usually has a Salutation or a
Greeting, the body, and the Signature.

7
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:35,419
In the Salutation, we usually put the name of the recipient.

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:40,044
A recipient is the person that is going to receive the letter.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,973
We need to make 10 letters.

10
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:47,973
But instead of typing different
names in the salutation for many times

11
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,397
We can just use mail merge.

12
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,636
Let’s click here and choose letter.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,583
Now, let’s click Select Recipients.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,513
You can add a new list or use an existing list.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,735
For this tutorial, we will use an existing list.

16
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:08,906
Let’s click here and choose this file.

17
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:13,272
Now, our recipient list has
been added to the document.

18
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:18,982
Let’s click the Edit Recipient List
to see the names of our Recipients.

19
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:24,205
As you can see, we have their
Last Name, First Name, and Title.

20
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:28,187
Click OK and let’s start the mail merge.

21
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:35,082
To add their Last Name, First Name, and Title
to the salutation click Insert Merge Field.

22
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:39,327
Just click Title, First Name, and Last Name.

23
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:42,974
Now, just click Finish and Merge

24
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:46,777
Then let’s click this so we
can see and edit our letters.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Amazing!

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,240
We now have 10 letters with different recipients.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,360
Excellent work!

28
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:57,613
Now you know how to use the Mail Merge.
