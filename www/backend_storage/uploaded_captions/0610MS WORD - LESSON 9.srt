2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:06,933
Hi there!

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,921
In this video, we will be learning about the Review Tab and View Tab.

4
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:17,746
The Review Tab has many tools that can help
you correct mistakes or finalize your document.

5
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:22,958
The View Tab has many tools that can help
you control the way you view your document.

6
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:26,900
First, let’s talk about Spelling and Grammar.

7
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:30,348
If you click this, a little box will pop up

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,348
And let you know the grammatical or spelling errors in your document.

9
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,562
Over here is the Thesaurus.

10
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:42,242
A thesaurus is like a magic dictionary that
helps you find similar words or synonyms.

11
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:48,590
To find out the synonym of a word, click the
Thesaurus and this little box will pop up.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,814
Type the word here and click this little search button.

13
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:58,869
All the synonyms or the words similar
to the word you typed will appear here.

14
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:00,415
This is the Word Count

15
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:06,532
It counts all the words, pages, characters
and paragraphs that are in your document.

16
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:09,568
Just click it and this little box will appear

17
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:14,778
Then you will see the number of
pages, words, characters and many more.

18
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:20,335
You can also see the number of words and
pages on the bottom left part of your screen.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,436
Now, let’s proceed to the View tab.

20
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:28,082
This is Read Mode, and this is what it will do to your document.

21
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:32,824
It makes it easier for you to read the
texts but you won’t be able to edit it.

22
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:36,194
This is Print Layout or the default view.

23
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:40,100
This is how it looks and it
lets you edit your document.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,807
This is Web Layout, it lets you
view your document like this.

25
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:49,501
This is Outline view

26
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:52,685
Your document will look like a bulleted
list.

27
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:56,405
To exit, just click Close Outline View.

28
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:59,281
And lastly, this is the Draft view

29
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:02,135
It looks similar to the Web Layout.

30
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:08,168
You can also change the Views by clicking on these
buttons on the right bottom part of your screen.

31
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:12,523
This is the Read Layout, Print Layout, and Web Layout.

32
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,568
You can also change the page movement.

33
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,347
This is the vertical page movement

34
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:22,769
It goes up and down if you use
the scroll bar which is right here.

35
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,785
This is the side-to-side page movement

36
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:29,725
If you click it, your document
will look like this and you

37
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,302
can move it from side to
side using the scroll bar below.

38
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,572
Remember the ruler?

39
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,325
You can check this to make the ruler appear.

40
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,112
And you can check this to make the gridlines appear.

41
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,402
The ruler and gridlines can be a guide for your document.

42
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:52,624
And this is the Navigation Pane, it will
let you find words in your document easily.

43
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:56,208
These right here are the Zoom options.

44
00:02:56,706 --> 00:03:02,524
You click Zoom and choose the Zoom
percentage or type it in this little box.

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,325
Click OK and you will be Zoomed in or Zoomed out.

46
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:11,999
You can also adjust the Zoom
by using this Zoom control bar.

47
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:16,359
Just drag this little rectangle
to the right to move closer to

48
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:20,311
the document and to the left to
move far away from the document.

49
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:24,586
If you want to look at one page at a time, just click this.

50
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:29,076
If you want to look at many pages at a time, just click this.

51
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:33,400
But if you want to zoom in on a page easily, just click this.

52
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,947
Good job!

53
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:38,853
