6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,158
Hello! Welcome to the Internet Literacy course!

7
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:26,004
Today we’ll be learning
how to be to be more cultured

8
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:29,576
and educated in using the
Internet in our everyday life.

9
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:31,584
Let’s start, shall we?

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,372
The Internet is a network of connection where millions of computers are connected to one another

11
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:41,998
which allows them to get information from other places

12
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:44,782
talk to other people from other places

13
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,717
watch videos and very much more.

14
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:55,890
Network, additionally, is just simply a connection between two or more computers that can share information.

15
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,729
Both were the greatest
inventions in the nineteen hundred

16
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:02,684
which changed lives of people forever

17
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,347
thus, making it easier than before.

18
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,176
Take a look around you!

19
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:11,670
Phones can now connect to the Internet as well as some televisions!

20
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:14,754
You can call a loved one million of miles away

21
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:16,471
watch a video on YouTube

22
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:19,767
play games online and even watch this course!

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,017
See

24
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:24,311
the Internet was made to quickly find information

25
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,006
provide communication

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,318
listen to music

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,624
watch videos

28
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:31,182
shop from your cellphone or computer

29
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:32,887
and other many reasons.

30
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:34,301
But wait

31
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,491
how does the Internet work?

32
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:40,715
Data or information moves over the Internet in an ability

33
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,313
which is called as ‘packet switching’.

34
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:47,340
Let’s say you want to send a message through Facebook’s Messenger

35
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:53,143
packet switching turns your simple ‘hello’ 
to someone else into tiny and separate pieces

36
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:57,800
before building it up normally again once
 it reaches  the person you’re talking with.

37
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:02,951
Packet switching allows many people to use the Internet at the same time.

38
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:07,202
There are basic components that makes us able to use the Internet.

39
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:10,203
First is the client which is usually you

40
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:12,474
who is accessing the Internet.

41
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:14,038
As you access it

42
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:16,894
you are requesting data from a given server!

43
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,092
Server, on the other hand

44
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:22,685
responds to your request and provides you information.

45
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:26,411
The client and server communicate with protocols!

46
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:31,576
Protocols are a set of rules that help client 
and server meet with one another.

47
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:35,888
They make sure that the data request is sent and received properly.

48
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:40,847
There are two protocols that every device has which are

49
00:02:41,674 --> 00:02:44,797
Transmission Control Protocol or TCP

50
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,535
and the Internet Protocol or IP

51
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:53,819
which every device such as cellphones,
laptops, computers, smart TVs and other have!

52
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:59,438
What both of these protocols do, is that 
the Internet Protocol, or IP

53
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:03,188
makes sure data on
the internet gets to the right place.

54
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,841
Then TCP or Transmission Control Protocol

55
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:11,688
makes sure the data is put in the right order, 
and none of it is missing.

56
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:17,646
TCP also helps to control traffic on the
internet so it does not get overloaded.

57
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,641
These internet components enable us to search information, watch videos and others within minutes.

58
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,063
How do we access the Internet then?

59
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:32,237
In order to access the Internet, we use what they call as a web browser.

60
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:40,566
A web browser is an application or program that allows us to look and interact with the information on the Internet

61
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:47,763
such as Browser, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, 
Microsoft Edge, Opera and many others.

62
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,737
Before accessing the Internet

63
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:53,656
make sure your device is connected 
to a working network connection.

64
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,231
After that, on your desktop

65
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,726
find a Google Chrome logo which looks like this

66
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,402
double click on it

67
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:05,375
and there we go, you have just accessed the Internet.

68
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:12,580
Upon the usage of a web browser, we are presented with Online Content which are simply the things that you see on the Internet.

69
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:20,046
Ranging from videos, images, information, messages and others are all examples of online content.

70
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:21,657
Good Job!

71
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:25,071
You’ve just finished learning the basics of the Internet!

72
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:33,841
Next, we will learn about navigating the Internet in a safe and responsible manner in order to use it actively and respectfully!
