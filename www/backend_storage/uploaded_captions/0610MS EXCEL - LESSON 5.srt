Lesson 5: Tables and Drop-downs

2
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:07,904
Hey there!

3
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:12,011
In this video, we will be learning
about tables and drop-downs.

4
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:14,052
Do you know what a table is?

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,245
A table is made up of rows and columns
and will help you arrange your data!

6
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:24,120
You can find the table button in the Insert tab of Microsoft Excel.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,770
It looks like this.

8
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:28,662
Now, let’s try making a table.

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,887
Here we have a list of
grocery items and their price.

10
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:35,735
Let’s highlight all the cells with data

11
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:40,158
then let’s go to the Insert tab
and click on the Table button.

12
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,818
Once this little box pops up

13
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:46,362
let’s check this little box and then click OK

14
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:49,312
There you go! We now have a table.

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,368
Would you like to make
our table look awesome?

16
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:53,702
Great!

17
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,245
Let’s change its color and style.

18
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:01,570
Go to the Table Design tab and
choose a table design from here.

19
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:03,110
Let’s choose this!

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,970
Wow! Our table looks nicer!

21
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:09,227
Now let’s talk about
this little arrow down

22
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:12,452
button that is seen in
every header of our table.

23
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:17,056
This button reveals all the sorting and filtering options.

24
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:20,616
Remember sort and filter from Lesson 3?

25
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:22,256
That’s right!

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,532
We can sort and filter each
column in our table automatically.

27
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:29,081
To insert a new row or column

28
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:32,372
go to the Home tab and click this button right here.

29
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,183
You can now insert a row above or below.

30
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:39,112
And you can also insert
columns to the right or to the left.

31
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:44,122
Now let’s calculate all the prices and find out the total price.

32
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,408
Do you think we should use the SUM formula?

33
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,716
Nope! We don’t have to!

34
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:54,004
Once you have a table in
Excel, you can find out the total by

35
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:58,552
simply going to the Table Design
tab and checking the Total Row box.

36
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:02,989
When you click it, the total row will
appear at the bottom of your table.

37
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:04,795
Amazing isn’t it?

38
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:07,358
Now let’s talk about drop-downs!

39
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:13,452
Sometimes when you make a table you need to
enter the same 3 or more data repeatedly.

40
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:16,795
Making drop-downs will make that job easier!

41
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:22,737
Let’s go back to the table we made earlier,
but this time I added a group column.

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,602
But it's empty, so let’s assign
these items to their groups.

43
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:33,029
Toothbrush, soap, and shampoo all go to the Toiletries group.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,537
Banana, milk, and bread all go to the Food group.

45
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:43,304
Now to categorize each item
easily, let’s make a drop-down.

46
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,657
To do so, let’s select
all the cells under

47
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:50,164
the group column and
then go to the Data Tab.

48
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:52,856
Click on the Data Validation button.

49
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,629
Now, click this little button and choose List.

50
00:02:57,163 --> 00:03:02,625
In the source box right here, we type in Toiletries, comma, Food.

51
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:07,031
Make sure that the two groups
are separated with a comma.

52
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:09,158
Then, we click OK.

53
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:11,935
Now let’s click on this cell.

54
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,345
Do you see the drop-down button?

55
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:19,235
Good! Let’s click it and choose the group for this item.

56
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:22,362
Toothbrush belongs to the Toiletries group.

57
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:24,870
Banana belongs to the Food group.

58
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:28,241
Finish the rest and this is what it should look like

59
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:29,741
Excellent!

60
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:34,116
Now we can easily group these
items using the drop-down menu!

61
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,017
Good job!

62
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,616
Now you know how to create tables
and drop-downs in Microsoft Excel.
