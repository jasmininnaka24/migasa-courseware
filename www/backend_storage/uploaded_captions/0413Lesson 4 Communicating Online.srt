Hi!

00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:14,984
Welcome to the Internet Literacy course!

6
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:19,655
Today we’ll be learning how to use the Internet to communicate online!

7
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:21,578
Let’s start now, shall we?

8
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:25,508
The internet has made online communication easier than ever

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,734
suddenly

10
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:32,795
we have the power to chat, laugh, and connect
with people all over the world in seconds.

11
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:34,662
But you may be wondering

12
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:41,037
how can I make sure I'm being safe, effective, and
using the best available tools in the digital world?

13
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:46,256
There are a lot of ways to communicate
online such as using Gmail and Facebook

14
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,943
but let’s focus on Gmail for now.

15
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:56,514
Gmail is a free email service made by Google that
allows you to create and send emails to other people.

16
00:00:56,913 --> 00:01:03,484
In order to access Gmail, let us first
open any web browser and go to google.com

17
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:08,164
Upon opening it

18
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:12,937
we can see on the top right-side
that it says G-mail, click on it

19
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:20,042
After that, we will be greeted by a new page
which allows us to create or sign in our account.

20
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,567
For starters, we should first create an account.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,309
Upon clicking on create an account

22
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:34,684

last name, username, two forms for password to confirm it.

23
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:42,770
Upon clicking on confirm

24
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:43,481
next

25
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,169
we need to input our phone number
in it to proceed with the creation.

26
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:53,450
This is done in order to verify that
we are creating an account for our use.

27
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:57,520
After that, we’ll have to input
other additional information

28
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:59,622
such as our birthday and gender.

29
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:01,348
Once that is complete

30
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,262
Click on next and confirm your account creation.

31
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,520

We are going to be sent straight away to our
interface showing us the content of our email address.
