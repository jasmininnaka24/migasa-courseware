Now you know how to use a clipboard properly.

107
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,280
Now let's move onto the character spacing formats.

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,700
Do you know what the character spacing format is?

109
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,250
Character spacing is the amount of space between the characters within the line.

110
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,390
Characters are letters numbers and symbols.

111
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,910
This is the Very Tight spacing.

112
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,900
The spacing on each character is very close to each other.

113
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,330
This is the Tight spacing

114
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,780
the spacing of each character is close to each other.

115
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,480
This is the Normal spacing

116
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,610
the spacing of each character it's not too close or not too far to each other.

117
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,250
This is the Loose spacing.

118
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,690
This spacing of each character is a litle far from each other.

119
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,090
This is the Very Loose spacing.

120
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,260
This spacing of each character is very far from each other.

121
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,560
Let's talk about letter case formats.

122
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,870
Lettert case format changes the letters into small and big letters

123
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,290
it also changes the arrangement of letters too.

124
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,750
This is the sentence case

125
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,660
this only makes your first letter big

126
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,550
this is the lower case.

127
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,430
This makes all your letter small.

128
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,650
This is the upper case.

129
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,410
This makes all your letters big

130
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,690
this is the capitalized case.

131
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,790
This makes all the first letters big on each word.

132
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,740
This is the toggle case.

133
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,050
This makes all the big letters smaller while all the small letters are bigger.

134
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,060
Congratulations.

135
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,140

Let's try and test what you have learned from our lesson.

143
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
Do you know about planets?

144
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,860
Today let's explore different planets we have in our solar system.

145
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,880
Let's start by choosing the title only slide and type planets inside of the textbox.

146
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,020

Wonderful

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
but the title is too small.

151
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,670
Let's make it bigger and the that should be in bold.

152
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,897
To do it

153
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,480
let's highlight first the text then go to the fonts section and click this bold button.

154
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,940
Now let's click this font size button to make the text bigger

In the title section you need to type "types of planets"

161
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,850
inside the textbox of the two content slide on the left content section

162
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,250
name at least three planets you know.

163
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,160
And each planet you should change their font. Font styles and font color.

164
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,449
To do it

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,270
click this text box in the title section.

166
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,390
