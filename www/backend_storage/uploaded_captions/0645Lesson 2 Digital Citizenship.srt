Good day!

6
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:19,697
Welcome to the Internet Literacy course!

7
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:24,526
Today we’ll be learning how to navigate 
the worldwide Internet properly!

8
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,237
Let’s start, shall we?

9
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:29,731
See, the Internet is full of contents

10
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:37,422
videos, photos, texts, basically information which is created by a particular person or organization.

11
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:44,172
Using the Internet makes you connect with other thousand computers where you transfer information to each other

12
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:46,029
even personal details

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:54,113
Due to this, it’s important to understand how to be safe and responsible while on the Internet because your device could be in danger.

14
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:59,749
As we use the Internet, we enter something what is known as a ‘Digital Environment’.

15
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:03,413
A digital environment is simply more than just the Internet.

16
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:11,647
It is the interaction of connected digital contents such as Facebook, YouTube and others from commercial, public and other providers.

17
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:17,935
This includes the Internet, the World Wide Web, 
mobile devices and networks, online apps

18
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,471
social media platforms, the media environment, online gaming

19
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:28,460
 and any developments resulting in access to 
or services needed to access the Internet.

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,139
With this

21
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:35,301
you need to follow basic guidelines upon 
the use of the Internet in order to keep safe.

22
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,345
Keep it online

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,291
don’t give out personal contact
details like mobile phone number, home address

24
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:46,525
name of your school or
anything that gives away your location.

25
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,356
Keep it legal

26
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:52,454
be aware of the legal consequences of online activities.

27
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:57,094
This includes downloading music and films or harassing other people.

28
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:02,179
You are not anonymous online and things can get traced back to you

29
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,437
If you receive a rude or embarrassing image don’t pass it on

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:14,459
Distributing unconsented pictures/videos/internet properties by internet is harassment and could be illegal.

31
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,053
Keep in mind

32
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,572
not everyone you meet or see online is reliable.

33
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:25,785
Online contacts are strangers no matter how long you have been talking to them or how friendly they are

34
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:32,160
Never arrange to meet someone you have only talked to online without checking with a responsible adult.

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,789
Keep in control

36
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:40,140
If you meet someone online and conversations make you feel uncomfortable report it to the police or to an adult.

37
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:43,640
If you get messages which disturb or upset you

38
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:48,309
don’t reply and keep a record to report to an adult or your internet provider.

39
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:50,515
Keep your friends safe

40
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:56,193
Think before you send a picture or video and always ask permission from your friends

41
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,610
Once you have sent a picture you have lost control of it

42
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,896
Respect the privacy of your friends and don’t give out numbers or emails without their permission!

43
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:07,069
Keep alert

44
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:15,312
ccepting emails, instant messages or opening files from people you don’t know or trust can get you into trouble

45
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:19,452
They may contain viruses or unpleasant messages.

46
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:21,281
Keep it secure

47
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,625
 Never give out your passwords.

48
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:32,043
Keep safe you have a right not to be harassed or bullied online. Make sure you tell someone if this happens to you.

49
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:33,809
Apart from this

50
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:36,805
there is also what they call ‘digital rights’

51
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:43,960
which makes it legal for people, like you, to create, use, access and publish content on the Internet

52
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:51,835
by using or accessing the computer. 
Examples of this are copyrights, trademarks and patents.

53
00:03:52,570 --> 00:04:00,343
A copyright means that a person owns a special right to something they made like a picture or a computer program

54
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:07,144
his means they get to decide 
if others can copy it or not, like the MIGASA app.

55
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:14,725
A trademark is a special name, picture, or symbol that belongs to a certain company, group, or person.

56
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:20,070
It's like the MIGASA courseware logo, which only belongs to MIGASA

57
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,314
Last, but not least, patents.

58
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:29,145
A patent is when someone makes something new
and useful, like a machine or a recipe,

59
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:35,654
and they have the right to stop other people from
making, using, or selling it for a while.

60
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:41,036
It's like having a special secret that only you can use for a certain time.

61
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:42,852
You did well!

62
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:46,219
