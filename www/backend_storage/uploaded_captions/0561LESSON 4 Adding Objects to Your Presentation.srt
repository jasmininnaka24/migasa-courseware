00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,770
Topic A: List

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,440
As you can see here we have a sample presentation.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,890
I'm going to teach you how to create the list

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,360
for the paragraphs or text you've been using for your presentation

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,410
But first let's highlight this group of text here.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,857
To highlight the text.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,420
You need to click and the hold the left mouse button and select group of text you wish to highlight.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,920
Like this.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,100
After highlighting the group of text.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,020
Click this button here.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,510
After clicking this button.

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,430
This bar will appear.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,820
Now click this bullet and numbering here.

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,920
And this will appear.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,070
The purpose of this bar is for you to customize the list you want the use for your group of text.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,710
Now let's pick this one here.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,530
Now let's choose some color here.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,420
Click this icon here and pick any color you want to use but for now let's pick black.

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,790
Then click the ok button.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,560
If you look at the side of your paragraph the dots will appear.

28
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,230
Now we're done using list for our text or paragraphs that we use for our presentation.

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,210
That's it for a list in power point presentation.

30
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,710
Topic B: Indents and Line spacing.

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,960
Indent and line spacing are two important features you can use to change the way text appear on the slide.

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,270
What is indents?

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,550
Indent or indention helps to format the layout of text so it appears more organized on your slide.

34
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,810
The fastest way to indent is to use the tab key.

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,900
Click on the space you want to indent.

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,760
For example here.

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,460
At the very beginning of the line.

38
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,160
Then press the tab key.

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,040
Look for the tab key in your keyboard

40
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,190
right here

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,210
Now your paragraph and look like this.

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,120
This space here is what we call indent for your paragraph to look organized.

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,860
This is what it looks like if all the paragraphs use the indention feature.

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,310
Next let's head for a paragraph spacing.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,950
I will teach you how to use spacing and.

46
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,660
Now highlight the text or paragraph then click this.

47
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,130
You can choose which spacing for your text that you would like to use from one point zero to three point zero.

48
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,950
Now lets pick one point five.

49
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,530
And this is what it looks like.

50
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:14,010
Your paragraph looks more organized.

51
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,520
That's it for indent and line spacing.

52
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:22,980
Topic C: Aligning, Ordering and Grouping Objects.

53
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,410
Now let's move to aligning, ordering, and grouping objects.

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,570
Aligning objects.

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,220
The purpose of the aligning objects is for the objects or pictures to look more organized and not messy.

56
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,290
Now as you can see here the objects are not organized.

57
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,720
To make it look organized.

58
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,260
First look for the shift key on your keyboard.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,520
which is here.

60
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,130
Now hold the shift key while clicking each object or pictures.

61
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,130
The object should look like this.

62
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,970
Next click the picture format in the toolbar

63
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,170
which is here.

64
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,540
Then click this button here.

65
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,730
And this will appear.

66
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,690
Now you can choose any alignment you wish to use.

67
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,510
Now let's try allign middle.

68
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,180
Now this is what that looks

69
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,310
more organized that's it for alligning objects for your presentation.

70
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,000
Now let's move to ordering objects.

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,500
The ordering is important when two or more objects overlap.

72
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,180
Because it will determine which objects are in the front or in the back.

73
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,150
When objects are added to a slide.

74
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,220
The levels of which they are place depend on the order in which they were added.

75
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,780
Although we've created the arrow in our example on the top level.

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,400
We can the just the level to place it beneath the the other items.

77
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,970
Now click shape format button.

78
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,280
Now click this.

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,470
And this will appear.

80
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,630
Click send to back.

81
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,270
Now this is how it looks like.

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,710
That's for the ordering objects in powerpoint presentation.

83
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,690
We’re almost done, hang in there!

84
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,710
Lastly grouping objects.

85
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:25,440
To confirm that multiple items stay together when they are moved or resized, you might want to group them into a single object.

86
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,330
Now let's try to group this objects or pictures.

87
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,110
Hold shift key in your keyboard then click each picture so it would look like this.

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,990
Now click the picture format button.

89
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
here.

90
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,860
Click this icon button here

91
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,300
and this will appear

92
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,830
Now click group.

93
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,040
And this is what it looks like

94
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,630
Congratulations.

95
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,710
Now you know how to add objects for presentation.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,540
That's all for lessons four adding objects for your presentation.
