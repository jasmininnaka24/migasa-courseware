LESSON 4: Basic Arithmetic Operations

2
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:08,933
Hi! Welcome to Lesson 4.

3
00:00:09,613 --> 00:00:12,163
In this video, you
will be learning about

4
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:15,249
basic arithmetic operations
in Microsoft Excel.

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,558
Do you know what an arithmetic operation is?

6
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,593
An arithmetic operation is
a mathematical operation.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,406
In this video, we will be using Addition,
Subtraction, Division and Multiplication.

8
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,330
First, let’s talk about Addition.

9
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,196
Addition is adding or combining two or more numbers.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,649
 1+1 is equal to?

11
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,256
That’s right!

12
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:41,110
It is equal to TWO.

13
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:45,607
We can do addition using our
hands, our minds, and a calculator.

14
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:49,097
 But we can also do it on Microsoft Excel.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,922
So let’s try it.

16
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:54,365
Let’s put the first number inside cell A1

17
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,738
and the second number inside cell B1

18
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,815
It should look like this.

19
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:05,937
Now, click on cell C1 and add the
Addition formula in the formula box.

20
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:11,508
In every calculation in Excel, you
must always start with the equal sign.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,954
Now, let’s add the Cell names.

22
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:18,006
 Let’s put A1, the plus sign, and B1.

23
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:25,631
Click enter and as you can see the C1 cell
now has the sum of A1 cell and B1 cell.

24
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,325
Next, let’s try Subtraction.

25
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,980
Subtraction is taking away one number from another.

26
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:34,419
10-1 is equal to?

27
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,313
Very good!

28
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:37,981
It is equals to NINE.

29
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,300
Let’s try doing it in Excel.

30
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:44,524
First, let’s put 10 in A1 and 1 in B1.

31
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,318
Click on C1 and let’s add
the formula in the formula box.

32
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,940
Don’t forget to put the equal sign.

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,804
A1, the subtraction sign, and B1.

34
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:58,121
Let’s click enter.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,890
Wow! Now we have the difference of 10 and 1.

36
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,950
Next, let’s try Multiplication.

37
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:10,221
Multiplication is when you take one number
and add it together a number of times.

38
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:14,767
For example, 5 multiplied by 4 is done like this

39
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:18,073
5+5+5+5.

40
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:21,842
We add 5 by itself four times.

41
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,588
And that is equal to?

42
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:26,547
Excellent! It is equal to 20.

43
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:28,434
Let’s do it in Excel.

44
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:32,126
Let’s put 5 in A1 and 4 in B1.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,645
Click C1 and add this in the formula box

46
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:40,068
equal sign, A1, the asterisk sign, and B1.

47
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,562
Then, click enter.

48
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:43,282
There you go!

49
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,013
 We now have the product of 5 and 4.

50
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,489
Lastly, we have Division.

51
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,859
Division is breaking a number
up into an equal number of parts.

52
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,485
If we divide 20 by 4

53
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,205
what do you think is the answer?

54
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,352
Let’s do it like this.

55
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:02,853
Imagine you have 20 balls and 4 boxes.

56
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:07,140
Now, let’s put these balls inside the 4 boxes.

57
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:11,275
Make sure that each box has the same number of balls.

58
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:13,842
How many balls are in one box?

59
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,130
Correct!

60
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,690
Each box has five balls.

61
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,850
And that is how you do division.

62
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,395
Let’s try it in Excel.

63
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:25,775
Put 20 in A1 and 4 in B1.

64
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,299
 Click on C1 and add this formula

65
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,497
equal sign, A1, slash sign, and B1.

66
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,415
Then click enter.

67
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:35,969
There you go!

68
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,430
We now have the quotient of 20 and 4.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,920
Wow you did so well!

70
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:46,520
In the next video, you will be
learning how to create tables!
