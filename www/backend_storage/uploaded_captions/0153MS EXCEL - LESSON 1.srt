Hey there! Welcome to the Microsoft Excel Course.

In this video, you will learn the basics of Microsoft Excel.

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,900
First, let’s define Microsoft Excel.

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,323
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet computer

6
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:25,168
program that is used to record and analyze data.

7
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,169
Do you know what data is?

8
00:00:27,502 --> 00:00:31,207
A data is any kind of
information, it can be in

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,935
the form of letters,
words, and even numbers.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,302
Now let’s start by opening Microsoft
Excel and clicking on “Blank Workbook”.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,766
Do you know what a workbook is?

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,300
A workbook is a collection of worksheets.

13
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:51,333
And a worksheet is a collection of rows and columns.

14
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,300
This is what a worksheet looks like.

15
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,933
Now, let’s go to the top-most part of your screen.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,291
Do you see these three buttons?

17
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:05,339
This is the save button, it will let you
keep your work inside the computer.

18
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:11,797
You can also press the control button and S
button on your keyboard to save your work.

19
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:16,045
This is the undo button, it will remove your last action.

20
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:22,079
And this is the redo button, this is
like a reverse for your undo action.

21
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:24,912
Now, let’s go over to the right side.

22
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,679
These are the main control buttons.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
This button will minimize your Excel

25
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:38,366
And this button will take you out of Microsoft Excel.

26
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:42,200
So, make sure not to click it unless you’re done.

Can you see the tiny rectangles?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,866
Those are called cells and cells will hold your data.
