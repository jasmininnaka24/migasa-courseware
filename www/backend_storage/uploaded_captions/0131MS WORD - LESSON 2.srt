Lesson 2: The Clipboard and The Paragraph

2
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:07,711
Welcome back!

3
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:14,400
In this video, you will learn how to use the clipboard and the paragraph formatting tools.

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:18,333
First, let's talk about the clipboard.

5
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:20,567
This is the clipboard.

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:25,634
To copy and paste a text, simply
highlight a text and click the copy button.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:31,412
Now, click on an area in your document
where you want to paste the text.

8
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:35,078
Click the paste button and there you have it.

9
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:38,790
 To remove it, let’s use the cut button.

10
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,345
Let’s highlight the text again and then click cut. There you go, the text is now gone.

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,456
There you go, the text is now gone.

12
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,723
Let’s move on to the Paragraph formatting tools.

13
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:52,056
Let’s start with the lists.

14
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:55,278
This is the bulleted list button

15
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:57,101
The numbered list button

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,501
And multi-layered list button

17
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,512
Let’s click the bulleted list button.

18
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:07,690
Now, let’s type different kinds of grocery items.

19
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:14,556
flour, eggs, milk, bread, shampoo, soap, detergent

20
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:18,112
Excellent! We have a short grocery list.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,680
This small circle is what you call a bullet.

22
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:28,191
If you want to change it, you can click on this button
and choose different bullet styles from the library.

23
00:01:28,347 --> 00:01:30,324
How about this square one?

24
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,791
Let’s click it.

25
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:34,635
Do you see the difference?

26
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:36,169
Good.

27
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:40,146
Now let’s change it into a numbered list.

28
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:43,480
 To do so, click this button.

29
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:47,746
Easy! Now you have a numbered grocery list.

30
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:50,289
Do you want a more organized list?

31
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,256
We can do that too!

32
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:56,823
Let’s organize our grocery items into two categories

33
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,256
Food and Toiletries

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,823
Type Food and click enter.

35
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:05,089
To add a layer, click Tab.

36
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:10,956
This automatically moves the next line a little
to the right and changes the bullet style.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440


38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,740
Now, let’s type flour, eggs, milk, and bread.

39
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:21,556
Type Toiletries and click enter then Tab.

40
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:25,790
Now type, shampoo, soap, and detergent.

41
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:27,756
Very good!

42
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,156
Now we have an organized multi-layered grocery list.

43
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,256
These are the other Paragraph formatting tools.

44
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,756
This button will align your text to the right.

45
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:43,990


46
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,890
This button will align your text to the center.

47
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:47,290
This button will align your text to the left.

48
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:51,523
And this button will align your text evenly.

49
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:55,323
This button will change the space between your texts.

50
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,623
This is called spacing

51
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:02,656
And these numbers represent the
amount of space you want in your document.

52
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,823
This is what a 1.0 spacing looks like.

53
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:10,956
While this is what a 2.0 spacing looks like.

54
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:13,923
These are the indention buttons.

55
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,590
This will move your text away from the margin
and this will move it closer to the margin.

56
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,856
A margin is made up of invisible lines that
serve as a guide for the text in your document.

57
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,490
 Now, let’s add a title for our grocery list.

58
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,923
Hmm, I want the title to look bigger but
I don’t want to use the font size button.

59
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:40,356
To do this, let’s look at Styles.

60
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:45,833
Click on this arrow down button to see more styles.

61
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,833
Let’s choose "Title" style for our title.

62
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,267
Excellent

63
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:56,033
Excellent! Now, the title is bigger and easier to read.

64
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,400
Good job for finishing Lesson 2.

65
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:05,533
In the next video, you will be learning
how to insert content in Microsoft Word.
